    <h1>Selectors of CSS</h1>
    <p>
        CSS provides 4 different ways of settings styles to the elements. 
        The list are as follows:
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Element Name</li>
            <li>Element ID</li>
            <li>Class Name</li>
            <li>Group Name</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <h2>Applying Styles by Element Name</h2>
        <p>
            Elements of the Document can be directly set with the style by using the tag Name of the element. All Elements matching to the tag will be applied with the mentioned style. U can also set the styles for its siblings, child elements as well as parent elements based on the DOM Structure of the Document.  
        </p>    
    </div>
    <hr>

    <div>
        <h2>Applying Styles by Element ID</h2>
        <p id="styleById">
            Not all elements can have the same style. So for specific elements U could set a new style either by inline styling or U could apply Style based on the Id of the Element. ID is said to be unique for the html document. U prefix the Selector with # so that it will be applicable only to that element of the matching ID.    
        </p>    
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <h2>Applying Styles by Class Name</h2>
        <p class="content">
            If U want to apply style on multiple elements of different types but will have a common purpose, then U can create a style based on what we call it as 'CLASS'. Here Class is not OOP class, but a kind of style applicable on a bunch of controls. <br>
            <em>
                NOTE: A Class Name cannot be starting with a number. Class Names are usually created based on the purpose of creating the style.
